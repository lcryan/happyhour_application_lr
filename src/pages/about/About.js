                            there live the blind texts. Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove right at the coast of the
                            Semantics, a large language ocean. A small river named Duden flows by their place and
                            supplies it with the necessary regelialia. It is a paradisematic country, in which roasted
                            parts of sentences fly into your mouth. Even the all-powerful Pointing has no control about

                            spring which I enjoy with my whole heart. I am alone, and feel the charm of existence in
                            this spot, which was created for the bliss of souls like mine. I am so happy, my dear
                            friend, so absorbed in the exquisite sense of mere tranquil existence, that I neglect my
                            talents. I should be incapable of drawing a single stroke at the present moment; and yet I
                            feel that I never was a greater artist than now. When, while the lovely valley teems

                            bed into a horrible vermin. He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a
                            little he could see his brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff
                            sections. The bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed ready to slide off any moment.
                            His many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of the rest of him, waved about
                            helplessly as he looked. "What's happened to me?" he thought. It wasn't a dream. His room, a
