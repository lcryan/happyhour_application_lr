**Welcome to the HappyHour Application!** 

**About the application** 
HappyHour is a cocktail-app about, well yes, the wonderful and abundant world of cocktails.
It is supposed to help the user to get a better overview about which cocktails are out there, how to prepare them and what they are actually supposed to look like in real life. 

Beneath you can see the homepage of the application: 













_Please see below for some more information about the usage and deployment of React:_

**Getting Started with Create React App**
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App]().

**Available Scripts**
In the project directory, you can run:

**npm start**
Runs the app in the development mode.
[Open http://localhost:3000 ]()to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

**npm test**
Launches the test runner in the interactive _watch mode.
See the section about running tests for more information.

**npm run build**
Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about deployment for more information.

**npm run eject_**
Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back!

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except eject will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use eject. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
